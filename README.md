# Topic modelling of Australian parliamentary press releases
============================================================

#### Created by Adel Rahmani

### The data
The data comes from the [GLAM Workbench website](https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-journals/) (follow the link at the bottom of the page to download the data),
and represents 12,619 parliamentary press releases harvested and kindly made available by [Tim Sherratt](https://timsherratt.org/).

### The analysis
The code `Analysis.ipynb` file is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook documenting my initial exploration of the data.
The code is written in Python 3.7.

### Requirements
If you are using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), you can reproduce my virtual environment
by using the provided  `environment.yml` configuration file. This can be done by running
    conda env create -f environment.yml
in a terminal.
